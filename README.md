# mario-hangman-game

My name is comprised of two primary divs: the "start page" and "game-page"

On page load, the Game Page is hidden, and is visible when the "start" button is pressed (which also hides the Start Page div)

I included an HTML audio element which autoplays on loop

For my primary Mario image, I used the HTML canvas element (with intention to add animations later on)

Unresolved items:
- Sound on/off button
- Disable duplicate letter guess entries (as of now letter background color fades, but key is still "pressable")
